## How to install
You need to do this step only once.
1. If you haven't already, install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) -> you should be able to launch it (some icon on the Desktop or some such)
2. Start Julia -> a Julia-terminal popped up
3. Copy: 
   ```julia
   import Pkg
   Pkg.activate(".")
   Pkg.add(Pkg.PackageSpec(url = "https://github.com/yakir12/CoffeeBeetles.jl"))
   ```
   and paste it in the newly opened Julia-terminal, press Enter
4. You can close the Julia-terminal after it's done running

## How to use
1. Start Julia -> a Julia-terminal popped up
2. Copy: 
   ```julia
   using CoffeeBeetles
   main()
   ```
   and paste it in the newly opened Julia-terminal, press Enter
3. The stats, tables, and figures have been generated in the current directory
4. You can close the Julia-terminal after it's done running

## Troubleshooting
1. When adding this package I got a
   ```
   Warning: julia version requirement for package CoffeeBeetles not satisfied
   ```
   You'll need to update your Julia to 1.4 or higher. 
2. Older versions polluting your general environment.
   Please try the following in a newly started Julia-terminal:
   ```julia
   import Pkg
   Pkg.rm(collect(keys(Pkg.installed())))
   ```
   restart Julia and follow the instructions above from the beginning.
